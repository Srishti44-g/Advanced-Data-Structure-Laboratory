- Recursive: 3

## üìä Time Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm/Operation | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Linear Search     | O(n)         | O(n)       | O(1)            |
| Binary Search     | O(log n)     | O(log n)   | O(1)            |
| Stack Operations  | O(1)         | O(1)       | O(n)            |
| Queue Operations  | O(1)         | O(1)       | O(n)            |
| Circular Queue    | O(1)         | O(1)       | O(n)            |
| List Operations   | O(1)/O(n)    | O(n)       | O(n)            |
